# RCB Profile Picture Generator - Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure you've completed all necessary steps before deploying the application.

## Pre-Deployment Checks

- [ ] Run the deployment check script: `./deployment-check.sh`
- [ ] Fix any issues identified by the deployment check script
- [ ] Ensure background images are added to the `bg` directory
- [ ] Test the application locally to verify functionality

## Frontend Deployment

- [ ] Update the `.env.production` file with your backend URL
- [ ] Build the frontend: `cd frontend && ./build.sh`
- [ ] Choose a deployment platform (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)
- [ ] Deploy the frontend build files
- [ ] Set environment variables on the deployment platform
- [ ] Verify the frontend is accessible at the deployed URL

## Backend Deployment

- [ ] Prepare the backend: `cd backend && ./deploy.sh`
- [ ] Choose a deployment platform (Heroku, Railway, Render, etc.)
- [ ] Deploy the backend code
- [ ] Verify the backend API is accessible at the deployed URL
- [ ] Test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or curl
- [ ] Check that the U2-Net model is downloaded correctly
- [ ] Upload background images to the server

## Docker Deployment (Alternative)

- [ ] Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
- [ ] Run the Docker deployment script: `./docker-deploy.sh`
- [ ] Verify both containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] Check container logs for any errors: `docker-compose logs`
- [ ] Test the application at http://localhost

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Visit the frontend URL
- [ ] Upload a test image
- [ ] Select a background
- [ ] Generate a profile picture
- [ ] Download the generated image
- [ ] Check for any console errors or warnings

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Ensure CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Set up HTTPS for both frontend and backend
- [ ] Limit file upload size to prevent abuse
- [ ] Implement rate limiting if necessary
- [ ] Consider adding authentication for production use

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- [ ] Set up monitoring for the application
- [ ] Create a backup plan for the background images
- [ ] Document the deployment configuration
- [ ] Plan for future updates and maintenance
- [ ] Consider setting up CI/CD for automated deployments

## Cost Management

- [ ] Estimate monthly costs for the chosen deployment platforms
- [ ] Set up billing alerts to prevent unexpected charges
- [ ] Consider scaling options for high traffic periods
- [ ] Optimize resource usage to minimize costs

## Documentation

- [ ] Update README.md with deployment information
- [ ] Document any custom configurations
- [ ] Create user documentation if necessary
- [ ] Share deployment details with relevant stakeholders
